title: Launching a New Pixelated Adventure 🚀
---


Hey, art lovers! 🎨✨ I've been brewing something super exciting and it's finally time to unveil it. Lately, I've been diving into the pixelated cyberpunk universe, and it's been an incredible creative journey. Ever since I replayed [Cloudpunk](https://nivalisgame.com/) in anticipation of [Nirvalis](https://nivalisgame.com/), I’ve been captivated by its intricate mix of retro vibes and futuristic feels. It even led me down memory lane with games like [Va-11 Hall-A](https://va11halla.fandom.com/). 💾🌆

The cyberpunk aesthetic has always fascinated me - those neon lights, gritty cityscapes, and the nostalgic charm of pixel art. So naturally, I went on a deep-cyberscrolling adventure 🕵️‍♀️ exploring ancient Nintendo games, discovering vintage game creators, and marveling at artists who bring 8-bit art to life.

One artist that truly blew my mind is Erik Jensen with his [computer key art](https://www.erikjensenart.com/computerkeyart) – talk about creativity! 😍 It's inspiring how he transforms mundane keyboard keys into stunning pieces. (One day I'll own one... one day!)

Immersed in this vibrant pixel world, I couldn't resist trying my hand at creating my own pixel art. Initially, I thought it’d be a short-lived experiment – just a quick creative fix – but here we are! 🎨💻

Now for the exciting part... I'm experimenting with a fresh way to share this project digitally while nodding to traditional art distribution methods like gallery showings and limited editions. Stay tuned for more updates and sneak peeks as we redefine how art can be experienced in the digital age!

I’d love to hear your thoughts on cyberpunk aesthetics or any cool artists you've stumbled upon recently! Drop your comments below or share this post with fellow art enthusiasts. Let's keep this creative conversation going! 🌟✨

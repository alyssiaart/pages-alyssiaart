I'm so excited to launch this new project.  I have been wanting to explore a new type of art for a while, but hadn't really *landed* on anything inn particular.  However, a couple months ago, in anticipation of the upcoming [Nirvalis](https://nivalisgame.com/) game, I replayed Cloudpunk and was inspired by the pixelated #cyberpunk aesthetic throughout.  (of course, I went back and played parts of [Va-11 Hall-A](https://va11halla.fandom.com/) )

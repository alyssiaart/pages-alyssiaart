# About

You'll notice that a lot of this project was inspired by 80s themes and aesthetic (with some early 90s thrown in), and that's probably because of the #cloudpunk inspiration.  As a result, even the profile image I made for myself has a bit of a Siousxie-in-a-cyberpunk-future look to it; at least the hair does!
